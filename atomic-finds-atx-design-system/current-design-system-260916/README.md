# Atomic Finds ATX — Design System

A working design system for **Atomic Finds ATX** — *"Tiny Time Machines for Your Home"* — the Austin
vintage rattan/bamboo furniture brand. Built from the brand materials in this directory.

Open `index.html` for the living documentation (it needs to be served, not opened as a `file://` URL,
so the relative CSS and font paths resolve):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8752 --directory design-system
```

**Guiding constraint, above every rule below: furniture is always the hero.** Everything in this system
exists to frame a piece, never to compete with it.

## Sources this was built from

Everything here traces to material in this directory:

| Source | What it settled |
|---|---|
| `Atomic_Finds_ATX_Brand_Bible_V1.pdf` | positioning, voice, palette by name, card contents, showroom structure |
| `Atomic_Finds_ATX_Website_Creative_Brief_Anthony.pdf` | experience principles, character hierarchy, showroom nav |
| `🛸 ATOMIC FINDS ATX.md` | tagline, Mamba + Pacifico, negative prompts, card front/back copy |
| `brand_system_sheet.png` | **the six palette hex values** — the only place they are written down |
| `Logos/Asset 1–3` | the three official lockups; confirmed set in Mamba |
| `atomic finds assets/fonts/Mamba.otf` | the display face (verified against the logo artwork) |
| `Atomic_Finds_The_Curators_Four.md` | the four curators, their lanes and voices |
| `Copy_Options.md` | slogans, hero headlines, CTAs |
| `🪐 The Atomic Inspection Team_ Official Stamps.md` | stamp verdicts and single-ink treatment |
| `atomic-inspectors/`, `Logo Concepts/` | Nacho and curator artwork |

The palette hexes were cross-checked by sampling the logo PNGs directly. See
**Palette provenance** below — the sampled values run softer than the stated ones, and that is expected.

## Decisions worth knowing

**1. Two accessible companion colors were added.**
Cream text on the locked burnt orange `#C8501E` measures **4.13:1** — it fails WCAG AA at button-label
size. Avocado on cream is **3.82:1**, large-text only. Rather than change locked brand values, the system
adds one darker step of each (`--af-orange-deep` 4.91:1, `--af-avocado-deep` 5.07:1) for text-bearing
surfaces. The locked hexes stay the graphic/display colors. **This is the one place the system adds to the
palette, and it is why.**

**2. Ink is olive, not black.** The darkest value in every source artifact is a deep olive — there is no
true black or white anywhere in the brand. So `--af-ink` is `#2B2E14` (11.32:1 on cream, AAA).

**3. Display type is fluid.** Mamba is a wide face; a fixed 80px hero overflows a 375px screen. The three
largest steps use `clamp()`.

**4. Shadows are flat, never blurred.** `--af-shadow-stamp` is a solid ink offset with 0 blur. The brand is
flat vector, so a blurred drop shadow is off-system. Don't add blur to these.

**5. Poppins is an addition.** Source material only ever says "clean sans" for body copy. Mamba and Pacifico
are named brand faces; Poppins is a reasonable stand-in and is freely swappable.

## Palette provenance

| Token | Stated (locked) | Sampled from logo art |
|---|---|---|
| `--af-orange` | `#C8501E` | `#CB6536` / `#C46543` |
| `--af-avocado` | `#6B7A32` | `#747A37` / `#7B7D38` |
| `--af-olive-teal` | `#2E5D4E` | `#59674C` |
| `--af-cream` | `#F3E6CE` | `#FDF3E1` |

The logo PNGs carry a paper-grain texture overlay, which lifts and desaturates every sampled value — which
is why they read softer than the stated palette. **The stated values are canonical**; the sampled column is
recorded here only so nobody "corrects" the tokens to match a textured export, or the exports to match the
tokens. If a flat vector master ever supersedes these PNGs, re-sample and revisit.

## The rules that make it look like Atomic Finds

- **Cream is the ground.** Most of the surface isn't colored — that's what keeps the palette from reading
  kitschy. Max two background colors per composition.
- **Pink can show up a bit more than a bare accent** — e.g. the badge color — while staying well
  short of a base or headline color.
- **One pattern per section, one role only** — (a) tone-on-tone hero background, (b) thin border/divider,
  or (c) card-as-frame. Never mix patterns or scales.
- **Credit the weave that's actually on the piece.** Solihiya Weave,
  Cane Webbing, Palma Weave, Open Rattan Lattice, Tight Wicker Sheet, Coiled
  Basket Wicker, Wrapped Reed Drum, and Sunburst Wrap are the real named
  textures in the catalog. Check the inventory sheet's Weave Pattern column
  per SKU to pick the right one — see `atomic-finds-heritage-pattern-spec.md`
  §5. Whichever name applies, it is never fused into the logo and never
  presented as brand IP.
- **Sparkle leads, starburst supports.** Both used sparingly; the starburst is never tiled.
- **Max three type levels** in one composition.
- **Nacho guides.** Nacho is the site's voice; the Inspection Team appears on stamps, tags and cards.
  Never reverse that hierarchy.
- **Every piece is named** — Orbit, Agnes, Ramona — and sold as an adoption, never as a SKU.
- **No emoji in customer-facing copy.** The 🛸🪐👽 in the planning docs are internal markers only.
- **Motion is warm and subtle**: fade/slide on scroll, 1px hover lift, slow sparkle twinkle. All of it
  honors `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Verified

Checked in-browser at 1280px and 375px:

- All three fonts load; Mamba resolves from the local `.otf`
- All 12 documentation images resolve; no broken assets
- No horizontal overflow at either width
- Stamp renders as a true circle; product media holds a 4:3 ratio
- Stamp shadow confirmed 0-blur
- Record-card fields go two-column on desktop, stacked below 26rem
- Contrast ratios in `index.html` are computed, not estimated

## Open questions

These need a decision from the brand owner rather than a guess from me:

1. **Scroll and hover motion beyond the basics** — the source material doesn't define it. Kept minimal
   here. Does bouncier motion suit Nacho's personality, or stay restrained?
2. **A UI icon set.** The brand's "icons" are illustrations (Nacho, curators, sparkle, starburst) — there's
   no icon system in the source. A real site will need one for nav, cart and form affordances. Deliberately
   not invented here.
3. **Illustrated Nacho.** Currently real photos plus the two illustration concepts. A single locked
   illustrated Nacho would firm up the product-card guide slot.
4. **Body typeface.** Poppins is confirmed.
5. **Logos.** There are 4 official logos (`Logos/Asset 1–4`). `Logo Concepts/` carries over from an
   earlier design system and doesn't apply here.
6. **Dark mode** is on hold for now.

## Not built

Flagged rather than silently skipped: showroom page templates (Living Room / Kitchen + Dining / Office /
Back Patio), email templates, Instagram post templates, and the Facebook Marketplace listing format. The
`atomic finds assets/PDF Templates/` folder holds PDF renderings of earlier versions of several of these —
the source files for those were not in this directory, so they are not reproduced here. Say the word and
they can be built on top of these tokens.

## Rebuild & Accessibility Architecture Updates (August 2026)

The design system, layout multiplier, card interactions, and WCAG accessibility parameters have been rebuilt and verified across the workspace:

### 1. Refactored Design Tokens & Spacing
- **Warm Cream Base (`#F3E6CE`)**: Now acts as the page background canvas ground (`--af-surface`) making up 95% of the visual layout.
- **Header/Secondary Typography**: Set headers (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`) and secondary text to Avocado (`#6B7A32`) and Olive/Teal (`#2E5D4E`).
- **Interactive Burnt Orange (`#C8501E`)**: Strict 5% visual weighting constraint enforced, reserved for primary buttons, active links, and focus rings.
- **8px Layout Grid**: Refactored spacing tokens (`--af-space-1` through `--af-space-9`) to strictly adhere to an 8px multiplier scale (`8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px, 80px, 120px, 160px`).

### 2. Card-as-Frame Passport Grid
- **Inner Framing**: Product cards float images inside an inner `#F3E6CE` background frame (`.hp-find__image-frame`) with generous padding, separating the product from the borders.
- **Expandable Passports**: Added a sliding data passport to each card featuring:
  - Weave type
  - Origin credit (e.g., *Solihiya · Philippines*)
  - Material list
  - Condition status
  - Finding location
  - Historical quote block
- **Buttery Grid Transition**: Implemented modern CSS transition using `grid-template-rows: 0fr -> 1fr` for a smooth slide-open effect.

### 3. Buttery Animations & Motion
- **Card Hovers**: Cards lift up on hover (`translateY(-4px)`) over `0.25s` with a crisp drop shadow offset.
- **Staggered Scroll-Reveal**: IntersectionObserver queues intersecting elements and staggers their fade-in/slide-up display by `50ms` steps.
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` global directives, immediately adding visual states and bypassing transitions for screen accessibility.

### 4. Accessibility & Bilingual Support
- **Keyboard Traversal**: Clear tab paths enabled for all buttons and interactive controls, highlighting with a prominent `2px Burnt Orange` focus ring offset by `4px`.
- **Screen Readers**: Dynamically toggles `aria-expanded` and `aria-hidden` attributes on expand states.
- **Mobile Tap Targets**: Interactive elements and buttons scale to a minimum touch target of `44x44px` on screen widths under `768px`.
- **Client-Side Translation Hooks**: Natively embedded `data-en` and `data-es` bilingual layout attributes across all navigation links, buttons, and headers, driven by a client-side header toggle widget.
- **Mandatory Compliance Pages**: Created templates for Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and an Accessibility Statement.
